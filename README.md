# Profit Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Profit Analysis Dashboard** using **SQL** and **Power BI** to analyze project costs, departmental budgets, and employee compensation across various departments. The goal is to gain actionable insights on budget distribution, project profitability, and resource allocation for different departments within the company.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction & Transformation**: Used SQL to pull data from multiple tables including Completed Projects, Upcoming Projects, Departments, Employees, and Headshots CSV files.
- **Data Visualization**: Designed interactive and dynamic dashboards in Power BI to present clear visual representations of departmental budgets, project costs, and overall financial performance.
- **Actionable Insights**:
  - Engineering and Marketing departments contributed significantly to overall project costs, comprising **₹225K** of the total budget.
  - **Human Resources** had a negative capital return of **₹25K**, identifying potential inefficiencies in budget allocation.
  - Top-performing departments based on profitability and budget utilization were **Engineering**, **Marketing**, and **Sales**.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and merging multiple tables.
- **Power BI**: For creating dashboards and visualizations to present key findings.
- **CSV Files**: Data sources containing project, department, and employee information.

## Dataset
The project involved the following datasets:
- **Completed Projects**: Details of all completed projects with their respective costs.
- **Upcoming Projects**: Data on future projects and estimated costs.
- **Departments**: Departmental budget allocations, goals, and performance metrics.
- **Employees**: Employee information including compensation, department, and job title.
- **Headshots**: Employee headshot images (not utilized in analysis but part of the dataset).

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes:
- **Project Budget Distribution**: Visual representation of project costs by department.
- **Department Performance**: Comparison of budget allocation vs. project success across Engineering, Marketing, Sales, IT, and HR departments.
- **Employee Compensation**: Analysis of employee compensation across departments and its relation to project success.

## Key Metrics
- **Total Budget Analyzed**: ₹570K across all departments.
- **Top Project Cost Contributors**:
  - Engineering: ₹110K (20.18%)
  - Marketing: ₹115K (26.32%)
- **Identified Potential Savings**: ₹25K in HR project spending inefficiencies.

## How to Run This Project
1. **SQL Queries**: Use SQL to extract and transform data from the provided datasets.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: Import the cleaned data into Power BI to create visualizations.
3. **Analyze the Results**: Use the interactive dashboard to explore key insights and performance metrics.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analytics on project success.
- Automate data updates from CSV files into SQL and Power BI for real-time analysis.
- Expand the scope of analysis to include more performance metrics across departments.
